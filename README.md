The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a global effort to develop and distribute vaccines to protect people against the virus. This visualization provides a comprehensive overview of the vaccination progress across the world by tracking the percentage of the population vaccinated in each country, along with other relevant data such as the number of doses administered, vaccine types, and the timeline of the vaccination campaign. This powerful visualization allows viewers to understand the global impact of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and helps to identify the countries that are leading the way in vaccinating their populations. By presenting this data in an accessible and easy-to-understand format, this visualization can help to inform and inspire the public to take action and support the ongoing efforts to end the pandemic.
